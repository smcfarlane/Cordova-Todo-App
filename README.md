# Cordova-Todo-App

This project is a simple todo app for me to learn cordova/phone gap and react.

Use "npm install" to download dependences

Check the gulpfile for a description of tack.  The default task will run all of the individual tasks and create a watcher.

This is not a complete cordova project. You will need to symlink the dest directory of this project to the www directory of a cordova project you create.
